            In the Sims 4 the player gets to create and design a person and house as well as buy packs that
            add items to the game. When in the Create-A-Sim menu, or the CAS menu, the player gets to pick
            how their Sim will look, and have up to 8 Sims in one household. There are a lot of different
            combinations that people come up with for their Sim with and without Custom Content, or CC, once
            the player is finished designing their Sim they get to pick a name, favorite things and how the
            Sim will act. After finishing in the CAS menu the player gets to pick where their Sim lives,
            and to start out they get 20,000 Simoleons to pick a lot. Once the player buys the lot that they
            picked, they can have their Sim get a job, make some friends, or just mess around. There is also
            a buy/build mode where the player can buy and build things that can help with whatever they are
            doing with their Sims. The player can buy a lot of different things such as kitchen appliances,
            bedroom items, things for living rooms, and decerations. In build mode the player can build
            walls, delete walls, and terrain the land.

            A Dance of Fire and Ice is a rythem game that starts out pretty easy but quickly gets more
            difficult , a few features that the game has are setting the offset of the devices sound by
            tapping to the beat that is played. The first few levels are getting the player used to how
            the game works, and teaching the first few simple things that they can do. There are different
            devices to play it on such as phones, or coumputers. To pick a level when playing on a laptop
            the player has to get the balls overto the level they want to play, when playing on a phone the
            player just swipes to the world and level that they want to play. There are also levels that
            other players have made, a lot of them are difficult if the player is still new to the game.
