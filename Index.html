            I enjoy a lot of different things such as reading, playing games, watching movies, and writing.
            My favorite type of books to read are fantasy, murder, and horror. My favorite games are Minecraft, 
            The Sims 4, and Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach. Minecraft and The Sims 4 are sandbox
            and creative games while Five Nights at Freddy's: Security Breach is a horror survival game about
            animatronics trying to get you. My favorite movies are Black Widow, Coraline, and the FNaF movie.
            The Black Widow movie is about how Black Widow became an avenger. Coraline and the FNaF movie are
            horror movies about how things aren't always how they seem. I am currently writing a few short 
            stories about different writing promts, neither of the stories have a title. One of the stories
            is about Satan taking over Earth and he spots a person, Satan is confused because the person
            is neither god, angel, demon, nor human but something more powerful.
            <br><br>
            My family includes my mom, little brother and our pets. We have a golden retriver named Wrigley,
            a cat named Raine, and a kitten named Wynstyn.Remington is 2 years younger than me, and he is
            in 9th grade this year. He likes to hang out with his friend, they both play games, watch
            shows, and play outside. My mom works from home as a cancer resgister and makes sure that we
            have what we need when we don't have a lot of money for things that we want. She also tries to
            make sure that we are able to have fun.
            <br><br>
            Wrigley is our Golden Retriever and he will be 7 this year, he doesn't like to be alone and if
            you leave him alone or he thinks that he is alone, he will start whimpering he also won't eat
            his food. Wynstyn Chili was found behind the Wendy's in Wauseon, he was a the Humane Shelter
            with is brothers and sisters, he is super cute and meows a lot with a lot of other noises.
            Raine was found in a shed as a kitten when we got her and she bats her paws at Wrigley and
            Wynstyn with her paw.
