            Coraline is about a girl who moves into a new house, she finds a little door that leads nowhere
            after he mom unlocks it. When Coraline's parents go to bed she tries the door again and notices
            that the door now opens to a tunnel that she can crawl through. Once Coraline gets to the other
            side she relizes that it looks a lot like her new house, and she meets the other mother. The 
            other mother starts of being really nice and getting Coraline what she asks for, but eventually
            when she asks Coraline to stay by asking if she can sew buttons over Coralines eyes. After 
            Coraline tells the other mother no, the other mother gets angry and starts going after Coraline.
            The other mother pushes Coraline into an old room, Coraline talks to other crildren that the other
            mother has captured. The kids help Coraline escape the other mother, when Coraline gets out and
            the kids thank her for helping them before leaving. Coraline and Wybie throw the key to the door
            down a well, and then play over by it.
            <br><br>
            There are some theroies about Coraline though, such as Coraline never left the other world and 
            Coraline throwing the key into the well gave it to the other mother, but that is a few of the
            theroies. The reason some people think Coraline never left the other world is because the cat
            can walk past something and dissapear, when he does this he goes back to the first world. At the
            end of the movie the cat walks past the sign and disapears, as Coraline and her parents are
            driving away from moving out. The other theory is that the well connects the two worlds, this
            is beacuse the well is so deep that they can't see the bottom. When things fall into the well
            no one can here them hit the bottom because it's so deep. So by Coraline throwing the key into
            the well she gave it to the other mother, but the other mother might try and use the key to go
            into the first world and trap more kids. There are people that think taht with the way Coraline 
            ended there might end up being a second movie where Coraline is grown and she goes back there with
            a kid. The other mother would try and go for her kid but then COraline would fight the other mother 
            again.
