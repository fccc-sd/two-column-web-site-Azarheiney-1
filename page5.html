            The Five Nights at Freddys, FNaF, game and book series has been around since 2014, and has grown
            to have 10 games, 3 book series and a movie. The first FNaF game came out in August of 2014, made
            by Scott Cawthon and FNaF1 is how everything in the FNaF series came to be.
        <br><br>
            The first game has the original animatronics in the Fazbear franchise, and the games have secrets
            in them. If the player looks to the camera 2b there is a chance that the poster will change from
            Freddy to a yellow bear named Golden Freddy, as well as looking at Pirates Cove the sign might say
            "IT'S ME" instead of 'Out of Order'. The second game, FNaF2, has 10 animatronics since the office
            doesn't have doors to keep the animatronics out, the flashlight that helps keep the animatronics
            away from the front part of the office. There are vents on each side that some animatronics will
            go through, if Balloon Boy makes it into the office he makes it so that the flashlight stops
            working for a little bit. On one of the cameras there is a music box that needs to be wound up,
            if the player lets the music box run out then the animatronic in the box will make its way to
            the office, there is no way to stop it when the music box runs out.
            <br><br>
            The FNaF communtiy has decided that William in the movie can't do basic math, as he tells both Mike
            and Vessnessa the they had one lob but they had two jobs. The scariest part was the end credit 
            scene where Balloon Boy appears in the taxi. Everyone that watches or knows of MatPat were suprised
            to see him in the movie. The part where Bonnie tries to get Freddy to see Mike when sneaking in 
            really funny because when freddy looks over he looks back at Bonnie, and doesn't seem very interested
            in the fact that there is nothing there.
        <br><br>    
            There are a bunch of different theories on everything in the FNaF series, a youtuber that made
            theories on FNaF is MatPat, he has made over 80 videos on FNaF theories alone. He also makes 
            theory videos on other games, books, cooking, and fashion. Other youtubers such as Astrilspiff
            and Backseat Gaming have made videos and have live streamed the game Five Nights at Freddys:
            Secrity breach, these youtubers have found bugs, glitches, and other ways to bend the game to do
            what they want it to do. Astrilspiffs most popular FNaF video is him doing 600%, it took about
            seventeen and half hours to complete without breaks. Beakseat Gaming and Astrilspiff have both 
            done a lot with the game, they have both beat the game backwards, without using Freddy, without
            jumping, only walking forward and without picking up any items.
