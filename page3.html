            Slenderman is a mystery book about a college student. His friend goes missing and he starts
            having nightmares about where she could be so he makes a post about it on reddit. Some of the
            comments on reddit tell him that slenderman is coming for him and if he tries to find his friend,
            and that he shouldn't look for her. If he looks for her and manages to bring her back, he won't
            be able to come back. While other comments are excited about how the story will turn out. He 
            decides to look for her anyways, and ends up with a friend to help share his story if he doesn't 
            come  back. He saves his friend but he doesn't come back with her and everyone is confused as to 
            where his friend was. His friend doesn't even know where she was, and the friend he made over 
            email decides to share the last recording of him onto reddit. Some of comments on the post are
            saying that they warned him, while others are upset at how the story ended. His classmates don't
            relize he is missing until his friend tries to text him to tell him that their friend is back.
